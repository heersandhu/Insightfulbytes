This repository contains a collection of coding projects and practice exercises for my school assignments and personal learning. You'll find a variety of projects implemented in Python, C, and R covering topics such as data structures, algorithms, data analysis and more. Each project is organized into its own folder, with detailed README files providing instructions and explanations. Whether you're a fellow student looking for inspiration, a coding enthusiast interested in exploring new projects, or an employer reviewing my coding skills, there's something here for you. Happy coding!
